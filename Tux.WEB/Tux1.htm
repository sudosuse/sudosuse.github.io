 is Tux, its the mascot of Linux and also the mascot of a lot of things since its
 actually free and everyone can use the mascots, and also let you use my drawings
 of him, ya didn't know ?

</p><p ALIGN=LEFT>He has also his own games, like SuperTux, SuperTuxKart or even
 some educational games, ya didn't know ?
</p><p ALIGN=LEFT>
</p><p ALIGN=LEFT>And also he is better since Linux is better than Windows. The
 original Tux was made on Gimp and saw a lot of iteration before we know the Tux
 that we all know. The mascot was created during mid 1997 and became the mascot
 of Linux in 2002, by an article that Linus Tolvards made on his blog.
